# Sales Prediction Task README

## Overview
This repository contains the code and data for the Sales Prediction task, where the objective is to predict sales based on various features. In this task, we perform data cleaning to handle missing values, conduct exploratory data analysis (EDA), remove outliers, and build predictive models using linear regression, random forest, and gradient boosting algorithms.

## Contents
- sales_prediction.ipynb: Jupyter Notebook containing the code for data cleaning, EDA, outlier removal, model building, and evaluation.
- sales_data.csv: Dataset containing sales-related information.
- README.md: This file, providing an overview of the project.

## Data Cleaning
- Addressed missing values in the dataset using appropriate techniques such as imputation or deletion.
- Ensured consistency and correctness of data types.

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Conducted EDA to understand the distribution and relationships between variables.
- Utilized visualizations such as histograms, scatter plots, and correlation matrices to analyze the data.
- Derived insights to guide feature selection and model building.

## Outlier Removal
- Identified and handled outliers in the dataset using statistical methods or domain knowledge.
- Ensured that outlier removal did not significantly impact the integrity of the dataset.

## Model Building
- Implemented linear regression, random forest, and gradient boosting models for sales prediction.
- Tuned hyperparameters where necessary to optimize model performance.
- Evaluated models using appropriate metrics such as mean squared error (MSE) or R-squared.

## Conclusion
This project showcases the process of data cleaning, exploratory data analysis, outlier removal, and predictive modeling for sales prediction. By leveraging various machine learning algorithms, we aim to accurately forecast sales based on available features.
